In investigating the efficient enforcement of mutual exclusion in distributed systems, particularly within shared memory contexts,
this study is related about the implementation and analysis of Dijkstra’s token ring algorithm under the paradigm of self-stabilization.
The primary objective centers on assessing the algorithm's efficacy in guaranteeing system-wide mutual exclusion with minimal performance
overhead and enhanced fault tolerance capabilities. By adopting a structured experimental design, the research employs a simulation-based approach
on a distributed platform to emulate a shared memory environment. This setup facilitates the thorough examination of the algorithm's response
to various fault scenarios, its stabilization time post complexity, and its overhead in terms of memory and processor utilization.
The findings reveal that Dijkstra’s token ring algorithm, despite its simplicity, exhibits robust fault tolerance and rapid convergence towards a
stable state, although with noticeable scalability constraints under high system load. Furthermore, the analysis illuminates the trade-offs between system scalability,
performance overhead, and fault recovery time, offering critical insights into optimizing the algorithm for larger distributed systems.
In conclusion, this research underscores the viability of Dijkstra’s token ring algorithm as a foundational strategy for achieving mutual exclusion in shared memory systems,
highlighting its potential adaptability to modern distributed architectures with considerations for scalability and efficiency enhancements.
